I began the project by performing data extraction, followed by data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA). With a focus on meeting the client's requirements and perspective, I utilized Microsoft Power BI to illustrate visualizations. These visualizations were generated using the most abundant resources tailored to the client's needs, incorporating key performance indicators (KPIs) and elaborate graphs. The aim of these visualizations was to present the performance of the companies, aiding in making informed judgments for future goal setting.
